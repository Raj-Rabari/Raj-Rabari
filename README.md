# Hi there, I'm Raj Rabari! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building high-performance applications, from robust desktop tools to complex web interfaces. I enjoy diving deep into the architecture of large-scale apps and finding ways to optimize them, whether that means extracting micro-frontends or writing custom C++ addons.

### 🔭 What I'm working on
* **Currently:** Building advanced frontend features at **Valorx**, taking ownership of complex UI components like custom code editors (with syntax highlighting and autocompletion) and Salesforce-like formula fields.
* **Previously:** Worked at **Asite Solutions**, where I developed an Angular/Electron desktop app, integrated micro-apps with legacy JSP backends, and developed Windows shell extensions for file explorer sync statuses. 
* **Side Project:** Building **ScriptWeaver**, an AI-powered content generation tool. 

### 🌱 What I'm learning & exploring
* Deepening my knowledge of backend development with **Node.js**.
* Exploring the modern capabilities of **C/C++**.
* Leveling up my skills to transition into **AI Engineering**.
* Planning to share AI tutorials, application reviews, and coding content on Instagram.

### 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Frontend:** Angular, Micro-frontends, UI/UX Design
* **Backend & Desktop:** Node.js, Electron, C++, JSP, SQLite
* **Concepts:** Performance Optimization, Desktop Integration (Windows Shell Extensions), Legacy System Integration
